### Online Library

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Javascript curriculum. 


The objective was to learn and practice with objects, object prototypes, inheritance chains, etc. by creating a book library with the options of adding and deleting books.

The project has no back-end so the library will reset after refreshing the page.

Live version available [HERE](https://kikupiku.github.io/book-library/)
